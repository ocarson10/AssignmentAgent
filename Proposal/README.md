# CSC 342 Project Proposal: Assignment Agent
### Olivia Carson, Mico Guevarra, Austin Heyward

College students are constantly on the move, from class to class, club to club, and between it all, they have to find some time to take care of themselves. With so much going on in their lives, it’s easy for tasks to slip through the cracks. One of the worst things to experience as  a college student is to realize you have a big assignment due later that night that you haven’t started yet, or even worse, to wake up the next day and realize you missed the deadline entirely.  Our app seeks to solve this problem by helping students keep track of their assignments and when they’re due. By using our app, students will have a centralized resource to easily check all of their assignment due dates, rather than having to check each syllabus/class website one at a time.

The most basic feature of our app is the ability to input assignments and their due dates. With each assignment, the user will be able to input a class code, the name of the assignment, the type of assignment (e.g. exam, project, homework, etc…), the due date and time, the grade received on the assignment out of 100, and whether the assignment has not been started, is in progress, or has been completed. Inputting the class code will allow the user to sort their assignments by class. The user will also be able to input the grading scale for each class. As the semester goes on and the user enters the grades they’ve received on their assignments, our app will use the assignment types and the grading scale to calculate the user’s projected grade in the class. This will give the user an idea of how well they’re doing in their classes overall and can help them prioritize which classes they need to be putting more effort into. As well as calculating each class's current grade, our app will calculate the student’s overall GPA for the semester. We find that giving the user access to their grades like this may give the user a sense of comfort, as they may be doing better than they expected, or if their grade is lower than they desire, it may give them a sense of urgency in order to bring it back up. We also have come up with a couple of stretch goals for our app: a calendar view, and the ability to automatically send push notifications/email reminders to users when they have a deadline coming up. Though we already plan to give the user the ability to sort assignments by due date, a calendar may help users visualize better when assignments are due, as well as give the app a more polished look. The notifications/emails will serve as an extra push to get the user to get started on/complete their assignments on time.

The data we need for our app to work is class and assignment information. Basically every user input mentioned in the paragraph above together makes up all the data we need, so it will all be acquired through user input. We shouldn’t need to interact with any third-party services using external APIs or anything since we are leaving all the data entry up to the user.

Our app will be implemented as a PWA. The mobile-first design of PWAs will be beneficial to students (who almost always have their phones available to them) so that they will be able to quickly and easily enter new assignments into the app, perhaps while the professor is reviewing due dates at the end of the lecture. In order to enter a new assignment in the app, the user won’t have to pull out their clunky laptop or risk forgetting about the assignment on their trip home where they can enter the assignment on their desktop. The offline functionality of PWAs will allow our app to send emails and push notifications to users even when the app is not active. The ability to send push notifications is another benefit to creating our app as a PWA.
